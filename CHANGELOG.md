# 0.0.2
- isLink was failing as we were missing the followLinks: false argument which caused it to return the type of the linked entity rather than the link.
- Fixed the X11 bug again. The find command mustn't traverse down symlinks as this can cause looping.
- Fixed stream listener logic in copyTree, replace and tail. You need to pause the subscription whilst processing an event otherwise events occur simultenaously which is not good thing when manipulating files.
- removed unnecessary await in backup.dart
- increased timeout for find_test so it could complete a full system scan.
- changed the witOpenLineFile method to use an async action as we were getting overlapping io operations because we were not waiting for the prior opration to finish.
- Moved to using the stacktrace_impl package.
- changed to async File.copy
- ported copy fixes from pre-core copy.
- Added asList method to the StackList class.

## 1.0.0

- Initial version.
